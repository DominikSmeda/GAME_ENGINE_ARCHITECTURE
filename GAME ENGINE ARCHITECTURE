“Game Physics Engine Development : How To Build A Robust Commercial Grade Physics Engine For Your Game : Second Edition” by Ian Millington

The quality of Millington’s book on Game AI is fantastic so I expect this physics book is as well.

about GJK and more, get Gino van den Bergen's book 'Collision Detection in Interactive 3D Environments'. Christer Ericson also discusses it in his new book.

In this devlog, I go over the process of me starting to create a physics engine. My engine is loosely based on Ian Millington's Game Engine Physics Development book, but it is likely to diverge farther from that in the near future. In this video I got collision detection, collision resolution, and linear impulse resolution working. The angular impulse resolution still needs some work to be more accurate, but it is almost there. This is part of my dungeon crawler devlogs, and is currently coded in Java using LWJGL3.
